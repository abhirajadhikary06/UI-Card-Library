## Journey

Embarking on this project allowed me to delve deeper into CSS techniques, such as positioning, transformations, and animations. I learned how to manipulate simple HTML elements to create intricate designs, enhancing both my technical skills and artistic expression.

One of the key takeaways was understanding the importance of planning and sketching designs before coding, which streamlined the development process. I'm particularly proud of how the final piece reflects the initial concept, demonstrating the potential of CSS in creating art.

Looking ahead, I aim to experiment with more complex animations and interactive elements, further blending art with functionality in web design.
